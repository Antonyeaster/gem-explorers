# Gem Exploreres

As a keen explorer myself, I believe Gem Explorers is the ideal site to visit if your looking for a new location to visit that has a little something extra about it, something not everyone knows...

Gem Exploreres is not about revealing secrets or disrupting the local areas, it's purpose is to point any other keen explorers in the right direction to discover the natural beauty of our world!

## Planning 

### Strategy

#### Site Aims:

It's a big decission deciding where to go on your adventures, also it can be quite a difficult one. Disscovering the world is such a huge expirence, and something I would call a must.

This site aims to give you the hand you might need to get on the road. This is done by giving you multiple posts to look through, with extensive information regarding a particular location. More so, you can engage with other users within the comments to build a community of eager explorers.
